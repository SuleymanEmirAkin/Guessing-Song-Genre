# Guessing-Song-Genre

For the Introduction to Data Science Course,  I build a classifier that guesses whether a song is a hip-hop or country, using only the number of times words appear in the song's lyrics.

This document was a modified version of project file used in Data 8 course of University of Berkeley.
This dataset was extracted from the Million Song Dataset (http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Specifically, we are using the complementary datasets from musiXmatch (http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch) and Last.fm (http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm).
