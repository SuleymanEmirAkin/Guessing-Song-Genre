    "# 1. The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is a table of songs, each with a name, an artist, and a genre.  For each song, we also know how frequently certain words occur in that song.  More precisely, we have a list of approximately 5000 words.  For each of these words, for each song, each item in the table describes the proportion of the song's lyrics that are the particular word.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the lyrics of \"In Your Eyes\" is 168 words long. The word \"like\" appears twice:  $\\frac{2}{168} \\approx 0.0119$ of the words in the song. Similarly, the word \"love\" appears 10 times: $\\frac{10}{168} \\approx 0.0595$ of the words. Therefore, `lyrics.where(\"Title\", \"In Your Eyes\").column(\"like\").item(0)` is about $0.0119$, and `lyrics.where(\"Title\", \"In Your Eyes\").column(\"love\").item(0)` is about $0.0595$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset doesn't contain all information about a song.  For example, it doesn't include the total number of words in each song, or information about the order of words in the song, let alone the melody, instruments, or rhythm. Nonetheless, you may find that word counts alone are sufficient to build an accurate genre classifier.\n",

    "## 2.1. Classifying a  song\n",
    "\n",
    "In k-NN, we classify a song by finding the `k` songs in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those songs with similar features the \"neighbors\".  The k-NN algorithm assigns the song to the most common category among its `k` neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each song.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"like\" and \"love\" in the lyrics.  Taking the song \"In Your Eyes\" (in the test set), 0.0119 of its words are \"like\" and 0.0595 are \"love\". This song appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  We will say that the *dissimilarity*, or *distance* between two songs is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features in a scatter diagram. This distance is called the cosine distance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the song *Insane in the Brain* (in the training set), 0.0203 of all the words in the song are \"like\" and 0 are \"love\".  Its distance from *In Your Eyes* on this 2-word feature set is $1-\\frac{((0.0119*0.0203) + (0.0595*0))}{ \\sqrt{0.0119^2 +0.0595^2} * \\sqrt{0.0203^2 + 0^2} } \\approx 0.20$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below creates a plot to display a test song and some training songs in a two-dimensional space defined by two features. As you can see in the result, *In Your Eyes* is more similar to *Sangria Wine* than to *Insane in the Brain*."
